/**
 * <p>
 * First of all : The Java Printing API ist the biggest mess I've ever seen.
 * It is extremely difficult to get the desired printing results with it.
 * But maybe I just don't understand the whole thing. No matter what, it works 
 * somehow and must be seen as experimental as long as someone comes along the way
 * who is able to fix the BlackBoard printing thing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This {@link Printable} creates an image printing for the current board
 * to be printed.
